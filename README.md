# 3 Challenges

## _Challenge 1:_ Mirror, Mirror on the Screen!
Apple Industries is working with an exciting new reflective display screen in our latest line of photo booths. While the
screen itself is cool, its reflective qualities mean we need to build our displays backwards, including the text! To
accommodate this, we’ll need some software that can take a sentence and reverse the order of the words.

## _Challenge 2:_ I’m feeling lucky!
At Apple Industries it’s important to remember that we sell fun: you and your friends climbing in one of our mega
booths for some silly group scenes, hanging out in the movie theater lobby and being part of the movie magic, making
your own memorabilia at a sports stadium or theme park. We also like winning prizes! Our booths have three types of
photo packages: prints (4x6 photo) for $5, panoramas (6x12 prints) for $7, and strips (two 2x6 photo strips) for $5. Once
per hour at most, we want one customer that orders each package type to have a chance to receive the other two
packages of prints for free. To do that, we’ll need some software that knows what package the customer ordered,
determines if that customer’s order is eligible to win, and then if they in fact won the free prints.

## _Challenge 3:_ Only two things in life are guaranteed…
Once per calendar month Agent Smith of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) wants to know how much tax we owe them.
For now, since our headquarters is in Long Island, New York, the IRS only requires us to pay the local sales tax rate of
8.625% no matter where the customer paid to use our photo booth. Luckily, we don’t need to pay taxes on the
packages we gave away for free. To make this easy, our accounting department will need some software that can add
up all the order revenue collected in a photo booth by calendar month and determine how much tax we owe the IRS.
